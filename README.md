# Killer Escape Memory card game

## Find the door and key to escape. Match two tiles with a horror Villain (Jason, Freddy, Pinhead, or Michael Myers) and be captured!

### Tasks:
-- Fix mobile design

-- Change card color on hover

-- Set logic to keep villain tiles shown to make it harder. And maybe have it reshuffle tiles if villains not match.
